A guide to the instrument codes used in the discography.

Brass bass (bb) indicates either tuba or sousaphone when it is uncertain which
of the two is used; and trumpet (t) indicates both cornet and trumpet for Rex
Stewart and Ray Nance, and both trumpet and flugelhorn for Clark Terry, who all
used regularly both instruments (Nance used cornet after 1960).
