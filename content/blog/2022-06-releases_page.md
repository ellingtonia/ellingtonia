We are happy to announce a new feature for Ellingtonia.com: a "Releases" page.
This contains a table for every release mentioned in the discography. While
browsing the discography, you can click any release to be taken to the correct
part of the releases page. Similarly you can click on the index number of any
entry on the Releases page to be taken back to the relevant part of the
discography.

In addition, the Record Labels page now features links to the releases for each
label.

There will be a few rough edges initially: some index numbers are incorrect, and
there are typos in the release names, but overall we hope this will be a useful
addition to the site.

Over time we'd like to bring you more information for each release. For some we
already have links to Discogs.com, Spotify, Tidal etc. In addition we hope to
add the title, year of release, format (LP, CD etc.). Watch this space!
