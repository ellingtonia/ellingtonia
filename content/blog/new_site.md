Welcome to the slightly refurbished ellingtonia.com.

After years of painstaking work on this discography, Marcus Girvan has retired from day-to-day work on this discography and handed it over to a new webmaster. This necessitated some technological changes and prompted a minor refresh of the site's look and feel. We hope you like it!

If the site isn't working properly for you, please get in touch with Charlie Dyson (charlie@charliedyson.net) and we will do our best to fix the issue.

We hope you continue to enjoy our discography whether as a researcher or Duke enthusiast. As ever, please get in touch if you spot any inaccuracies or omissions.
