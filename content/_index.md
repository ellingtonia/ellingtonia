*"Some Day all the jazz musicians should get together in one place and get down on their knees and thank Duke."*

The principal aim of this site is to provide as full an on-line discography of the recorded works of Duke Ellington as possible. The discography was created by Marcus Girvan, drawing on many sources including Massagli and Volont√©'s "The New DESOR", The DEMS Bulletin and archive, [DESUK's](https://dukeellington.org.uk) "Blue Light", Ken Vail's "Duke's Diary", Dr. Stratemann's "Duke Ellington - Day by Day and Film by Film", Mark Tucker's "Ellington - The Early Years" and last but by no means least, David Palmquist's ["The Duke: Where And When" (TDWAW)](http://tdwaw.ca), the essential guide to The Duke's itinerary.

Please note that due to the sheer quantity of recorded output, the pages on this site can be large and are not well-suited to use on mobile devices.

As with all discographies, this will always be a work in progress and cannot be thought of as definitive. Errors and omissions are still being found. Decades after Duke's last recording, new compilations continue to be released on CD, LP and via streaming services. Corrections and contributions are gratefully received.

Marcus has now retired from day-to-day maintenance of this site. Please contact Charlie Dyson (charlie@charliedyson.net) if you spot something that's missing or wrong. A list of known bugs is maintained [here](https://github.com/ellingtonia/ellingtonia/issues), while changes to the discography are recorded on the [Changes]({{< ref "changes" >}}) page.
